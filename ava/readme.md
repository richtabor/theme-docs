# Getting Started

## Activate your License Key
It’s strongly recommended that you add your theme’s license key in the Ava License widget on your WordPress Dashboard. By adding your key, you will activate the seamless theme updates and have access to our support team. 

You can find your theme’s license key by checking your purchase receipt or signing in to your ThemeBeans dashboard. If you purchased the theme from ThemeForest, you may [request your license key here][1]. You’ll need your ThemeForest purchase code handy.

Copy this key and enter it into the **Ava License** widget on your WordPress Dashboard. Save and activate your license key.

## Install the Child Theme
If you plan on modifying anything within the theme files directly, please install the included child theme. If you change anything within the theme folder and approve an update from our servers **your modifications will be lost**. By using a child theme you will ensure that your changes are preserved.

Log in to your website's dashboard and navigate to the Dashboard \> Appearance \> Themes page. Click **Add New** and follow the directions to upload the ava-child.zip file, located in your theme’s package download.

Simply click **Activate** and both the Ava theme and Ava child theme will be active on your WordPress site. Now have at it.


## Install Recommended Plugins

Please install the recommended WordPress plugins through the notice at the top or your admin dashboard. If you do not plan on using specific elements, such as the portfoliox, team or WooCommerce shop features, then there’s no need to install those.

Once clicked, you will be taken to the Plugin Installation admin view, where you may install and activate each plugin, as depicted [in this screenshot][2].


## Install the Demo Data
When you first activate Ava, it will look like a simple website with your existing content. This is expected since Ava needs you to modify a few settings before it will look exactly like the demo. 

Optionally, you may install our Ava demo data, which will populate your site with the pages you see on our live demo. This can give you a head start in setting up your site. Once you get your site setup and get the hang of it, you may delete the unwanted posts or pages as you see fit.

You can find the ava.xml data file in the theme package download. You can install this XML file by going to **Tools** → **Import** → **WordPress** and click **Choose File**. Upload the XML file and follow the steps to import. Please note that you should have all required custom post type plugins installed before importing the data - otherwise, you’ll need to re-import the .xml file.

When the demo data is finished importing, you should have several new posts and pages to work with going forward.


## Prepare your Images
In order to get the best looking images in Ava, we need to refresh your images to be cropped to Ava’s image sizes. We do this with the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin.

After activating the plugin, go to **Tools** → **Regen. Thumbnails**, then press the **Regenerate All Thumbnails** button to start generating new image sizes. Once it’s finished, your library of images will be optimized and ready to go.



# Navigation
To set your menus, locate the Menu options by selecting the “Appearance” tab from the dashboard sidebar and then “Menus”.

Once you’re viewing the Menus, create a new menu and save it. After you’ve saved the menu, you can add it to a menu via the Menu Settings, below the Menu Structure area. Add your pages and links to the menu you just created in the Menu Structure area.

## Social Menu
The social icons added to your menu will automatically populate in the site footer. To add the icons, simply create a custom link to the social media location and Ava will do the rest.

To also display the inputted social icons in the sidebar, simply check the Navigational Social Icons checkbox within the Customizer \> Settings \> Headersection.



# Using Beaver Builder

[Beaver Builder][3] is quite a powerful page builder. With relative ease you can recreate our live demo templates and build your own to suit your needs.

## Building your Pages

Simply add a new standard WordPress page and jump into Beaver Builder by clicking the Page Builder tab. [Click here][4] to view a screenshot. Once you’re in the page builder, you have quite a few options to start at.

## Selecting a Template

When the page builder opens, you will be prompted to select a layout template to begin with. Starting with one a bundled tempalte is optional.

There are two groups of templates: Ava Templates - which comprise of the various page layouts, and Ava Portfolio Templates - which are portfolio layouts. You can choose the templates to view at the top right dropdown selector as seen in this [screenshot][5].

## Set Global Settings

You can use Beaver Builder’s Global Settings to change default settings for whether rows are full width or fixed, and, if fixed width, the maximum width in pixels for the row. By setting the default row width and row content width settings, it means that every time you create a row, the row widths are initially set to those defaults. You are free to change individual row settings to something else. Here’s a [screenshot][6].

The following are the settings that we've deployed on the live demo:

1.	In Page Builder, click "Tools" then "Global Settings"
2.	Set the “Default Row Width to “Full Width”
3.	Set the "Modules Margin" value to 0
4.	Set the "Row Max Width" value to 1100px

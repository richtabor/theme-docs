# Getting Started

## 1. Activate your License Key
It’s strongly recommended that you add your theme’s license key from within the License section of the WordPress Customizer. By adding your key, you will activate the remote theme updates and have access to our support team.

You can find your theme’s license key by checking your purchase receipt or signing in to your ThemeBeans dashboard.

If you purchased the theme from ThemeForest, you may [request your license key here][1]. You’ll need your ThemeForest purchase code handy.

Copy this key and navigate to the **Customizer License Control** located within the **WordPress Dashboard > Customizer > Theme License** section.

Enter your license key and hit activate.

You'll see a "Verified" report upon a successful activation. If the license does not activate, please refresh and try again.

## 2. Install the Child Theme
If you plan on modifying anything within the theme files directly, please install the included child theme. If you change anything within the theme folder and approve an update from our servers **your modifications will be lost**. By using a child theme you will ensure that your changes are preserved.

Log in to your website's dashboard and navigate to the Dashboard \> Appearance \> Themes page. Click **Add New** and follow the directions to upload the ava-child.zip file, located in your theme’s package download.

Simply click **Activate** and both the Ava theme and Ava child theme will be active on your WordPress site. Now have at it.

## 3. Install Recommended Plugins
Please install the recommended WordPress plugins through the notice at the top or your admin dashboard. If you do not plan on using specific elements, such as the portfolio, team or WooCommerce shop features, then there’s no need to install those.

Once clicked, you will be taken to the Plugin Installation admin view, where you may install and activate each plugin, as depicted here:

## 4. Install the Demo Data
When you first activate Ava, it will look like a simple website with your existing content. This is expected since Ava needs you to modify a few settings before it will look exactly like the demo.

Optionally, you may install our Ava demo data, which will populate your site with the pages you see on our live demo. This can give you a head start in setting up your site. Once you get your site setup and get the hang of it, you may delete the unwanted posts or pages as you see fit.

You can find the ava.xml data file in the theme package download. You can install this XML file by going to **Tools** → **Import** → **WordPress** and click **Choose File**. Upload the XML file and follow the steps to import. Please note that you should have all required custom post type plugins installed before importing the data - otherwise, you’ll need to re-import the .xml file.

When the demo data is finished importing, you should have several new posts and pages to work with going forward.

## 5. Prepare your Images
In order to get the best looking images in Ava, we need to refresh your images to be cropped to Ava’s image sizes. We do this with the [Regenerate Thumbnails][2] plugin.

After activating the plugin, go to **Tools** → **Regen. Thumbnails**, then press the **Regenerate All Thumbnails** button to start generating new image sizes. Once it’s finished, your library of images will be optimized and ready to go.

## 6. The Blog
You don't need a blog template or Beaver Builder template to achieve the blog layout. Simply assign a page as the Posts page in the Customizer \> Static Front Page setting.




# Beaver Builder
[Beaver Builder][3] is quite a powerful page builder. With relative ease you can recreate our live demo templates and build your own to suit your needs.

## Activating Beaver Builder
Simply add a new standard WordPress page and jump into Beaver Builder by clicking the Page Builder tab. Once you’re in the page builder, you have quite a few options to start at:

![][image-2]

## Selecting a Template
When the page builder opens, you will be prompted to select a layout template to begin with. Starting with one a bundled template is optional.

There are two groups of templates: Ava Templates - which comprise of the various page layouts, and Ava Portfolio Templates - which are portfolio layouts. You can choose the templates to view at the top right dropdown selector:

![][image-3]

## Using Modules
We’ve built quite a few custom modules that are packaged within Ava. You can use these modules to build out any web page as you see fit. Any modules can be placed on any page - giving you unlimited possibilities.

## Set Global Settings
You can use Beaver Builder’s Global Settings to change default settings for whether rows are full width or fixed, and, if fixed width, the maximum width in pixels for the row. By setting the default row width and row content width settings, it means that every time you create a row, the row widths are initially set to those defaults. You are free to change individual row settings to something else.

![][image-4]

The following are the settings that we've deployed on the live demo:

1.  In Page Builder, click "Tools" then "Global Settings"
2.  Set the “Default Row Width to “Full Width”
3.  Set the "Modules Margin" value to 0
4.  Set the "Row Max Width" value to 1100px

## Beaver Builder Pro

The free version of Beaver Builder is downloadable from the WordPress.org repository and will work flawlessly out-of-the-box, but if you want more advanced modules and the ability to save your own templates, you’ll want to purchase the [paid version][4] of the plugin.

Beaver Builder is really a great product and we’re committed to developing more wonderful modules and templates for Ava.

## Beaver Builder Pro Modules

Beaver Builder Pro has quite a few great modules that we have included support for in Ava. Please not that all modules on the live demo are available on the free version of Beaver Builder, except for the Accordion module as seen on the Ava demo FAQ page.

To add accordions (and other shortcodes), simply add the shortcode to the Text Editor module within the builder.




# Site Editing

To access the live Customizer and edit your site’s design, you may select the Customize button in the admin bar dropdown or select **Customize** from the Dashboard menu. Note that you must be logged in as a site administrator in order to access the controls.

## Contextual Links
You'll notice various "Edit" elements throughout the Customizer Site Editor viewport, which open relevant options panels pertaining.

## Theme Options
There are hundreds of theme options within Ava to let you modify colors, theme elements (headers, footers, etc), sizes, positioning, fonts and icons.

## Widget Areas
Adding widgets has never been easier with our new contextual widget spaces. Simply click on the little "nibs" to add a widget, select your widget from the panel - and you're done.

# Navigation
To set your menus, locate the Menu options by selecting the “Appearance” tab from the dashboard sidebar and then “Menus”.

Once you’re viewing the Menus, create a new menu and save it. After you’ve saved the menu, you can add it to a menu via the Menu Settings, below the Menu Structure area. Add your pages and links to the menu you just created in the Menu Structure area.

## Social Menu
The social icons added to your menu will automatically populate in the site footer. To add the icons, simply create a custom link to the social media location and Ava will do the rest.

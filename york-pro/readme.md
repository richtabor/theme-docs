# Menus
It is rather important to set your theme menu in the WordPress Dashboard. To do this, locate the Menu options by selecting the “Appearance” tab from the dashboard sidebar and then “Menus”.

Once you’re viewing the Menus, create a new menu and save it. After you’ve saved the menu, you can add it to a menu via the Menu Settings, below the Menu Structure area. Add your pages and links to the menu you just created in the Menu Structure area.

## Footer Menu
Add a footer menu to your webite simply by creating a menu and assigning it to the Footer Menu location - as described above.

[Click here][1] to set your footer menu. 

## Social Menu
The Social Menu is populated in both the site footer and sidebar elements of the theme. The social icons added to your menu will automatically populate in the site footer. To add the icons, simply create a custom link to the social media location and York Pro will do the rest.


To also display the inputted social icons in the sidebar, simply check the Navigational Social Icons checkbox within the Customizer \> Settings \> Headersection.

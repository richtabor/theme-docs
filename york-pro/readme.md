# Getting Started

## Activate Your License
We strongly recommend that you add your theme’s license key in the Getting Started page. By adding your key, you activate the seamless theme updates as well as begin receiving theme support. 

With theme updates enabled, you’ll get a notification in your dashboard whenever there is an update available. You can then update right in your WordPress dashboard, keeping your site healthy and secure.

You can find your theme’s license key by checking your ThemeBeans purchase receipt or signing in to your ThemeBeans dashboard. Copy this key and enter it into the _York Pro License_ widget on your WordPress dashboard. Save and then activate your key. Your license key should now be active.

## Installing the Child Theme
There is one main reason why you would want to use a child theme. If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then **your modifications will be lost**. By using a child theme you will ensure that your changes are preserved.

Log in to your website's dashboard and navigate to the Dashboard \> Appearance \> Themes page. Click **Add New** and follow the directions to upload the york-pro-child.zip file, located in your theme’s package download.

Simply click **Activate** and both the York Pro theme and York Pro child theme will be active on your WordPress site. Now have at it.

## Installing Demo Data
When you first activate York Pro, it will look like a simple portfolio with your existing posts. This is expected since York Pro needs you to modify a few settings before it will look exactly like the demo. 

Optionally, you may install our York Pro demo data, which will populate your site with the pages you see on our live demo. This can give you a head start in setting up your site. Once you get your site setup and get the hang of it, you may delete the unwanted posts or pages as you see fit.

Download the York Pro demo data here. You can install this XML file by going to **Tools** → **Import** → **WordPress** and click **Choose File**. Upload the XML file and follow the steps to import. 

When the demo data is finished importing, you should have several new posts and pages to work with going forward.
  
##Preparing Your Images
In order to get the best looking images in York Pro, we need to refresh your images to be cropped to York Pro’s image sizes. We can do this with the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin.

After activating the plugin, go to **Tools** → **Regen. Thumbnails**, then press the **Regenerate All Thumbnails** button to start generating new image sizes. Once it’s finished, your library of images will be optimized and ready to go.

# Navigation
It is rather important to set your theme menu in the WordPress Dashboard. To do this, locate the Menu options by selecting the “Appearance” tab from the dashboard sidebar and then “Menus”.

Once you’re viewing the Menus, create a new menu and save it. After you’ve saved the menu, you can add it to a menu via the Menu Settings, below the Menu Structure area. Add your pages and links to the menu you just created in the Menu Structure area.

## Footer Menu
Add a footer menu to your webite simply by creating a menu and assigning it to the Footer Menu location - as described above.

## Social Menu
The Social Menu is populated in both the site footer and sidebar elements of the theme. The social icons added to your menu will automatically populate in the site footer. To add the icons, simply create a custom link to the social media location and York Pro will do the rest.

To also display the inputted social icons in the sidebar, simply check the Navigational Social Icons checkbox within the Customizer \> Settings \> Headersection.

**Please be nice.** You should always be nice to the support personal. The folks on our support team really do enjoy helping others, but you can really ruin their day by using negative words.
